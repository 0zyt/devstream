# DevStream PMC Guide

## The DevStream PMC

The DevStream project management committee (PMC) is a committee with responsibility and governance for DevStream's top level projects.

While committers on the project have the ability to update the code, only the PMC as a body has the authority to vote on formal releases of the project's software. 

The PMC is also responsible for voting in new committers and PMC members to the project.

## PMC Chair

Every PMC has a Chairperson and so does DevStream PMC. The Chair is the interface of the project.

The term period of the PMC Chair is 1 year. 

If the PMC wishes to change the Chair, a vote should be held, or a consensus should be reached within the PMC, about who the new Chair should be.

## PMC Member

A PMC member is a committer who was elected due to merit for the evolution of the project.

They have write access to the code repository, the right to vote on community-related decisions, and the right to propose other active contributors for committership.

The PMC as a whole is the entity that controls the project, nobody else. In particular, the PMC must vote to approve any formal release of their project's software products.

## Standards

If you meet one of the following standards, you are eligible (note: not guaranteed) to be invited as a PMC member:

- you made significant contribution to DevStream's core modules;
- you contributed to multiple DevStream's plugins;
- you made significant contribution to DevStream's testing;
- you contributed frequently to DevStream's documentation, blogs, or community events;
- your company is an early end user of DevStream and you are the main person who adopted DevStream in your company.

## Add a PMC Member

Adding a PMC member requires sending a notice to the PMC of the vote to add someone. The PMC Chair or any other PMC member can send this notification.

To formally add the candidate to the PMC, the PMC Chair needs to formally invite the new PMC member.

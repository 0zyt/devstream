# Contributing to OpenStream

Thanks for contributing, and thanks for reading this doc before doing it!

This is a set of guidelines for contributing to OpenStream. These are only guidelines, not rules. So, use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document.

## How Can I Contribute?

Report bugs, create issues, propose new features by creating an issue with the corresponding issue template, and label it accordingly.

If you intend to change the public API or make any non-trivial change, filing an issue first is recommended. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before putting significant effort into it.

If you are only fixing a bug, itâ€™s OK to submit a PR without an issue. In this case, Filing an issue is still recommended because it helps us track the issue.

## Maintainer Team at Merico

A group of engineers maintains OpenStream at Merico, led by [@ironcore864](https://github.com/ironcore864).
